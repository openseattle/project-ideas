# Open Seattle Project Ideas 
Want to get involved in an Open Seattle project? In addition to browsing our current [active projects](https://github.com/openseattle), you can also check out the list of open project ideas. 

These are project ideas submitted by members that might not have a leader yet (maybe it's you!) or that need to be fleshed out a bit more to get started. 

## Browse Project Ideas 
Thinking about starting a new project? Want to see what ideas other members have submitted? Check out project ideas [here](https://github.com/openseattle/project-ideas/issues).

See a project that looks interesting? Click on it and feel free to join the discussion. 

## Submit a New Project Idea
Got an idea for a new project and want to share it with our community? Get started by following these steps!

- First things first: [Create a Github account](https://github.com/join) if you don't already have one.
- Next, take a quick look at [our existing project ideas](https://github.com/openseattle/project-ideas/issues) to see if a similar idea already exists. If it does, feel free to click on the project, read the discussion, and add your comments!
- If your idea isn't already listed, add it. 

**Adding Your Idea**

- On the Issues tab, click the green "New Issue" button. 
- Add a title and a description for your idea. The more info you can provide, the better! That will help other members understand your idea and be more inclined to jump on board. 
- One of Open Seattle's organizers will respond to your project idea and will likely comment with some questions or feedback and next steps on how to get other members involved. 

## Managing Your Project Idea
Once you've added a project idea, we'll assign you as the issue owner. We'll then expect you to keep members posted on the status of your idea by posting an update at least once a month. That way, we know that you're still interested in the project.  

## Help! I'm Not Very Technical and This Seems Hard 
No worries! We promise it's not, and we'll be happy to help you submit your project idea. Email us at hi@openseattle.org or ping the #getinvolved channel in the Open Seattle Slack and we can help.  


*Major props to [Open Austin](https://github.com/open-austin) for this repo idea!*
